How this affects you
********************

If you’re starting with a new installation, you don’t need to worry about this. 
Don’t even bother reading this section; it’s for upgraders.

You need to replace your current source with the content of https://github.com/iago1460/django-radio.
To setup your settings please read the configuration section.

You should be able to keep your current database but make sure to create a backup before start.



.. warning::

    This migration depends on ``settings.LANGUAGE_CODE`` it will convert
    `the role field <https://github.com/iago1460/django-radio/issues/11>`_ into a editable CharField
    using your preferred language. Note you can change this value temporally to run this migration.
    `More info <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/settings/#language-code>`_.


.. warning::

    You must ensure your episodes and programmes only have one role per user. A database constraint
    has been put in place as part of this migration.
