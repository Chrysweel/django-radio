How this affects you
********************

If you’re starting with a new installation, you don’t need to worry about this. 
Don’t even bother reading this section; it’s for upgraders.

You need to replace your current source with the content of https://github.com/iago1460/django-radio.
To setup your settings please read the configuration section.

You should be able to keep your current database but make sure to create a backup before start.


.. warning::

    You must ensure your episodes and programmes only have one role per user. A database constraint
    has been put in place as part of this migration.


.. warning::

    This migration depends on ``settings.LANGUAGE_CODE``, it will convert
    `the role field <https://github.com/iago1460/django-radio/issues/5>`_ into a editable CharField
    using your preferred language. Note you can change this value temporally to run this migration.
    `More info <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/settings/#language-code>`_.


.. code-block:: bash

    python manage.py migrate


.. note::

    If you have a custom production enviroment please consider our
    `staging setup <https://github.com/iago1460/django-radio/tree/master/radioco/configs/staging>`_ to improve performance.


Or if you are using our docker setup:

.. code-block:: bash

    inv docker.clean -e staging
