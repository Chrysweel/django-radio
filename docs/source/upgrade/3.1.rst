How this affects you
********************

If you’re starting with a new installation, you don’t need to worry about this. 
Don’t even bother reading this section; it’s for upgraders.

You need to replace your current source with the content of https://github.com/iago1460/django-radio.
To setup your settings please read the configuration section.

You should be able to keep your current database but make sure to create a backup before start.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r radioco/configs/base/requirements.txt
    python manage.py collectstatic
    python manage.py migrate

Or if you are using our docker setup:
